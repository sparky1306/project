# How a Capacitor Works - Final Project

My Final Project was to create an instructional webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

## Why this topic?
In my Electronics class in college, I had a hard time understanding how a capacitor worked.  Then in my Physics class, we learned how it works from a physical perspective, and suddenly it made sense!  So I wanted to help others understand, too.

## Accuracy
This representation is from an electrical current (amps) perspective.  So the plus signs represent the current flowing.  Technically, it is the electrons (negatively charged particles) that are flowing, and they are flowing in the opposite direction of the plus signs.  However, for someone who is trying to understand a capacitor from an electrical perspective, this representation will make more sense.  So while technically not 100% accurate, it is appropriate for the intended audience.  A day may come when the standards of the electrical community change, when the direction of current flow matches that of the electrons, BUT IT IS NOT THIS DAY!
